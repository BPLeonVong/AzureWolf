Generate a text or binary dump of a model. This is the core component of Assimp\textquotesingle{}s internal regression test suite but it could also be useful for other developers to quickly examine the contents of a model. Note that text dumps are not intended to be used as intermediate format, Assimp is not able to read them again, nor is the file format stable or well-\/defined. It may change with every revision without notice. Binary dumps ($\ast$.assbin) are backwards-\/ and forwards-\/compatible.

\subsubsection*{Syntax\+:}


\begin{DoxyCode}
assimp dump <model> [<out>] [-b] [-s] [common parameters]
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsubsection*{Parameters\+:}

{\ttfamily  model~\newline
}~\newline
 Required. Relative or absolute path to the input model. 

{\ttfamily  out~\newline
}~\newline
 Optional. Relative or absolute path to write the output dump to. If it is ommitted, the dump is written to {\ttfamily $<$model$>$-\/dump.\+txt} 

{\ttfamily -\/b~\newline
 }~\newline
 Optional. If this switch is specified, the dumb is written in binary format. The long form of this parameter is {\ttfamily --binary}. 

{\ttfamily -\/s$<$n$>$~\newline
 }~\newline
 Optional. If this switch is specified, the dumb is shortened to include only min/max values for all vertex components and animation channels. The resulting file is much smaller, but the original model can\textquotesingle{}t be reconstructed from it. This is used by Assimp\textquotesingle{}s regression test suite, comparing those minidumps provides a fast way to verify whether a loader works correctly or not. The long form of this parameter is {\ttfamily --short}. 

{\ttfamily  common parameters~\newline
}~\newline
 Optional. Import configuration \& postprocessing. See the \hyperlink{common}{common parameters page } for more information. 





\subsubsection*{Sample\+:}


\begin{DoxyCode}
assimp dump test.3ds test.txt -l -cfull
assimp dump test.3ds test.txt -include-log -config=full
\end{DoxyCode}


Dumps \textquotesingle{}test.\+3ds\textquotesingle{} to \textquotesingle{}test.\+txt\textquotesingle{} after executing full post-\/processing on tehe imported data. The log output is included with the dump.


\begin{DoxyCode}
assimp dump files\(\backslash\)*.*
assimp dump files\(\backslash\)*.* 
\end{DoxyCode}


Dumps all loadable model files in the \textquotesingle{}files\textquotesingle{} subdir. The output dumps are named {\ttfamily $<$mode-\/file$>$-\/dump.\+txt}. The log is not included.
